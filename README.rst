This repo holds some tests and random stuff used in the process of building
state machines for services like EIP for `Bitmask`_.

.. _`Bitmask`: https://github.com/leapcode/bitmask_client


There is a ``workflow-to-digraph.py`` file that generates an image of how it
looks the state machines right now.
